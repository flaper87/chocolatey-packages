    <description>
      Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

      A modern system requires access to a multitude of secrets: database credentials, API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. Understanding who is accessing what secrets is already very difficult and platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

      The key features of Vault are:

      * **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io), and more.
      * **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.
      * **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as SQL without having to design their own encryption methods.
      * **Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in Vault have a _lease_ associated with it. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.
      * **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.

        storage, auto unseal, and authentication.  

      IMPROVEMENTS:

       * auth/jwt: Groups claim matching now treats a string response as a single
         element list [JWT-63]
       * auth/kubernetes: enable better support for projected tokens API by allowing
         user to specify issuer [GH-65]
       * auth/pcf: The PCF auth plugin was renamed to the CF auth plugin, maintaining
         full backwards compatibility [GH-7346]
       * replication: Premium packages now come with unlimited performance standby
         nodes

      BUG FIXES:

       * agent: Allow batch tokens and other non-renewable tokens to be used for
         agent operations [GH-7441]
       * auth/jwt: Fix an error where newer (v1.2) token_* configuration parameters
         were not being applied to tokens generated using the OIDC login flow
         [JWT-67]
       * seal/transit: Allow using Vault Agent for transit seal operations [GH-7441]
       * storage/couchdb: Fix a file descriptor leak [GH-7345]
       * ui: Fix a bug where the status menu would disappear when trying to revoke a
         token [GH-7337]
       * ui: Fix a regression that prevented input of custom items in search-select
         [GH-7338]
       * ui: Fix an issue with the namespace picker being unable to render nested
         namespaces named with numbers and sorting of namespaces in the picker
         [GH-7333]
